Byron first dealt with the subject in _The Giaour_ (1813):

> But first on earth, as Vampyre sent,  
> Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent;  
> Then ghastly haunt thy native place,  
> And such the blood of all thy race;  
> There from thy daughter, sister, wife,  
> At midnight drain the stream of life;  
> Yet loathe the banquet, which perforce  
> Must feed thy livid, living corse,  
> Thy victims, ere they yet expire,  
> Shall know the demon for their sire;  
> And cursing thee, thou cursing them,  
> Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
> 
> This poem is in the public domain.

\[A quick look at _The Giaour_ online shows a poem in rhyming couplets lamenting the fall of classical Greece and its descent into modern degeneracy; a giaour seems to be some kind of Greek laird, or landed gentleman\].
